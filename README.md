# 📊 Code Complexity Analyzer

This is a full-stack web application built by **Vikas Sahu** that analyzes the **time and space complexity** of Java code using AI. Users can paste code, select a language (currently Java), and receive a real-time complexity report generated by the backend.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Input Java code and analyze complexity  
- ⚙️ AI-based detection of Time and Space Complexity  
- 🔁 Fetch API with a 10-second timeout for graceful failure  
- 🌀 Tailwind-powered loading screen while processing  
- ⚠️ User-friendly error handling and alerts  
- 🎯 Optimized for clean UI and usability

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### 🔹 Frontend
- ReactJS
- Tailwind CSS
- Fetch API with timeout control

### 🔹 Backend
- Java Spring Boot
- RESTful API (`/api/complexity/getComplexityReport`)
- Receives code + language and returns complexity report

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vikas-sahu/code-complexity-analyzer.git
cd code-complexity-analyzer
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### 3. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Make sure your Spring Boot server is running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## 📤 Sample API Request

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/complexity/getComplexityReport`  
**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "code": "public class A { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\"Hello\"); } }",
  "language": "java"
}
```

**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "Current_Time_Complexity": "O(n log n)",
  "Current_Space_Complexity": "O(n)",
  "Optimal_Time_Complexity": "O(n)",
  "Optimal_Space_Complexity": "O(1)"
}
```

---

## 🧪 Test Code

Paste large test cases like QuickSort or Recursion-heavy code to observe how the app handles complex scenarios, slow responses, or timeouts (10-second fetch timeout is built in).

You can place long sample codes in a file like `test-code/QuickSort.java`.
